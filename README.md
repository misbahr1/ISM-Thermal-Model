# About

This project aims to provide a simple framework to create a thermal model. *More details to be added when ready.*

This is still **WORK IN PROGRESS**. The files in [](./thermalmodel) contain all the classes for the implementation.

The general structure of the various elements is described with the following class diagram.
![Class Diagram](./class-diagram/output.png)

A sample implementation can be found in [](./example.py)

# NOTE

The example code does not run currently because some calculations methods are not implemented yet.
